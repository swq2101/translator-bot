# translator-bot

This translation chatbot uses Keras API to implement a seq2seq encoder-decoder model for machine translation. Thanks to Code Academy for help learning chatbot architecture, preprocessing, and natural language processing.

# data set

I sourced my French to English data set (fra.txt) from the following link:

http://www.manythings.org/anki/

You can download your desired language from this website and change your filepath on line 9 of preprocessing.py.


# what's next?

I'd like to add a GUI and improve the accuracy of the model by exploring Keras features further.
