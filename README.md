# translator-bot

This translation chatbot uses Keras API to implement a seq2seq encoder-decoder model for machine translation. Thanks to Code Academy for help learning chatbot architecture, preprocessing, and natural language processing.

# what's next?

I'd like to add a GUI and improve the accuracy of the model by exploring Keras features further.
